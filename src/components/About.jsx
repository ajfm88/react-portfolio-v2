              I'm a very ambitious Software Engineer and front-end developer
              looking for a role in a tech company with the opportunity to work
              with the latest technologies on challenging and diverse projects.

              I am passionate about building excellent software that improves
              the lives of those around me. I aim to improve myself and hone my
              coding and problem solving skills daily. The tech world advances
              at a rapid pace and the only way to keep up is to be on top of the
              latest technologies.
            </p>

              I am also a fitness enthusiast, an avid reader (both fiction and
              non-fiction), a language learner (currently at an intermediate
              level in Japanese), and a foodie (Yelp Elite status).
